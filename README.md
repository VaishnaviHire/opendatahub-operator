# opendatahub-operator
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster


### Installation

The latest version of operator can be installed from the community-operators catalog on OperatorHub. It can also be build
and installed from source manually, see the Developer guide for further instructions.


#### Build Image

- Custom operator image can be built using your local repository
    ```
    make image -e IMG=quay.io/<username>/opendatahub-operator:<custom-tag>
    ```
  The default image used is `quay.io/opendatahub/opendatahub-operator:dev-<VERSION>`


- Once the image is create, the operator can be deployed either directly, or through OLM. For each deployment method a
  kubeconfig should be exported
  ```
  export KUBECONFIG=<path to kubeconfig>
  ```

#### Deployment

**Deploying operator locally**

- Define operator namespace
  ```
  export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=<namespace-to-install-operator>
  ```
- Deploy the created image in your cluster using following command:
  ```
  make deploy -e IMG=quay.io/<username>/opendatahub-operator:<custom-tag>
  ```

- To remove resources created during installation use:
  ```
  make undeploy
  ```

**Deploying operator using OLM**

- Define operator namespace
  ```
  export OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=<namespace-to-install-operator>
  ```

- To create a new bundle, run following command:
  ```commandline
  make bundle
  ```
  **Note** : Skip the above step if you want to run the existing operator bundle.


- Build Bundle Image:
  ```
  make bundle-build bundle-push BUNDLE_IMG=quay.io/<username>/opendatahub-operator-bundle:<VERSION>
  ```

- Run the Bundle on a cluster:
  ```commandline
  operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/<username>/opendatahub-operator-bundle:<VERSION> --namespace $OPERATOR_NAMESPACE

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
